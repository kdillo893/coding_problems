# coding problems

This is a set of my work regarding various coding challenges that I come across.

Coding questions are a perfect way to become accustomed to Test Driven Development (TDD).
Prior answers weren't writing tests beforehand, but in the future I will write tests
in the language used to support my answers prior to writing the functionality.

## datastructs

These are coding data abstract data structures in C. Might split this off if
I need to import the data structures in other projects in the future.

The main purpose is to go through old notes and accomplish the tasks I had done
previously with Python in C, as C will be a language where engineers constantly
need to create their own structs for these and similar data abstractions.

### running datastructs
nothing really yet...

### testing datastructs
nothing really yet...

## codingQuestions
These contain my answers to coding questions asked on websites like leetcode.

I decided to parse these into sub-folders so I can organize the structure of 
various things as I would need them in real environments for execution.

### leetcodeC
This contains a set of C problems answered previously.

#### Running

```
make
```
will create the object files and place them in the appropriate locations. This 
generates a file "leetcode", which is an executable that runs each of the tasks
in a test.

```
./leetcode
```

#### cleanup
```
make clean
```

### leetcodeJava
